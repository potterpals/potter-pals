    <string name="book1Summ">"Harry Potter lives at Number Four, Privet Drive, in Little Whinging, England with his terrible adoptive family, the Dursleys. The poor orphan lives a mistreated life, living in the cupboard under the stairs. On his 11th birthday, mysterious letters begin to arrive, addressed to Mr. Potter. They are invitations to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns from the half giant Hagrid that not only is he a wizard, but he's the most famous orphan in the magical world.

Hagrid tells Harry that he received the lightning bolt scar on his forehead after an attack from the Dark Lord Voldemort, ten years earlier. It was during this assault that Harry lost both of his parent. Voldemort lost his powers and disappeared when he was unable to kill Harry. Hagrid takes Harry from his aunt and uncle's and shows him around the wizarding world, through Diagon Alley, a street full of magical shops that is hidden from the non-magical people known as "muggles". Harry learns of the fortune he has inherited at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. After buying books, a uniform and his magic wand, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railroad station, platfrorm 9 3/4.

On the arrival to Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into the House of Gryffindor, along with his new friends, Ron and Hermione. Draco Malfoy, a boy Harry meets and instantly takes a disliking to, is sorted into the House of Slytherin, the former house of Voldemort. After learning of his natural talent for flying, Harry learns about Quidditch, a soccer-like game played while flying on broomsticks, and becomes the youngest Seeker the Gryffindor team has had in a hundred years.

During the Halloween feast, a troll is found in the dungeon. Harry and Ron save Hermione from the attack, strengthing their friendship. Instead of returning to the Dursleys' for Christmas break, Harry decides to stay at Hogwarts. He stumbles across the Mirror of Erised, which shows the deepest desire of the one who gazes upon it. He sees himself surrounded by his parents and family. He also receives an Invisibility Cloak, a present that will help him out many times to come. After one of their crazy adventures, Harry and Hermione find themself in trouble. As punishment, they must go into the Forbidden Forest with Hagrid to find an injured unicorn. Harry finds a cloaked figure drinking blood from a unicorn. A centaur informs him the cloaked man was none other than Voldemort, trying to maintain his phantom existence.

Harry, Ron and Hermione find out that the legendary Sorcerer's Stone is being guarded by a three-heade dog. They learn that Hagrid told a stranger how to get past the dog. Figuring it's Voldemort that's trying to steal the stone, the trio goes on a courageous adventure to protect it. Using Ron's skill of chess, Harry's skill of flying and Hermione's magical knowledge, Harry finds himself faced with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell.

Quirrell informs Harry that the secret to find the Sorcerer's Stone lies within the Mirror of Erised. Harry looks into the mirror and sees himself holding the stone before putting it into his pocket. Magically, the stone actually materializes in his pocket. After lying to Quirrell about what he sees in the mirror, Quirrell unravels his turban to reveal Voldemort's face on the back of his head. Voldemort orders Quirrel to kill Harry, but unable to, Quirrel is destroyed and Harry blacks out. Upon awakening Harry is greeted by the Head Master Dumbledore. He explains to Harry that it was the power of his mother's love that prevents Voldemort from being able to harm Harry. At the end of the year feast, the trio and another fellow housemate earns Gryffindor enough house points to win the House Cup."

    <string name="book2Summ">"Harry finds himself back at the Dursley house for summer break. He hasn't heard a single word from either of his friends, but he also cannot send letters to them because his owl is to remain caged up the entire time it's there. Restless, Harry cannot wait to get back to Hogwarts and away from his miserable muggle relatives. One day, a house elf named Dobby shows up and warns Harry that he cannot return to Hogwarts this school year. It is revealed that Harry has in fact been receiving letters from his friends, but Dobby has been intercepting them, in order to make Harry feel abandoned, hoping to persuade him to not return to school. Dobby begins wreaking havok when Harry won't promise to stay away from Hogwarts to get Harry into trouble and sabotoge his chance of returning to school.

Ron and his twin brothers show up in a flying car to break Harry out of his imprisonment at the Dursleys, and he spends the rest of the summer with Ron's family. Harry and Ron mysteriously get blocked from the entering platform 9 3/4 and end up missing the train to Hogwarts. They decide to use the flying car to just drive to school. After crash landing into the Whomping Willow, the two end up in trouble before school even starts. Trouble seems to just escalate as Harry follows a menacing voice that only he can hear, resulting in the discovery of a petrified Mrs. Norris, Argus Filch's cat. Next to her a mysterious message is written on the wall: "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." Professor Dumbledore says the juice from a full-grown Mandrake can cure a Petrified being, but it will take time for the Mandrakes to mature.

The students soon learn the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. Salazar Slytherin, one of the school founders, left behind secret chamber that houses a dangerous monster that only his heir can control. This evil creature specifically targets witches and wizards who were born to muggle parents. During an incident, Harry involuntarily speaks Parseltongue, the language of snakes that was spoken by Salazar Slytherin. The makes most of the school believe Harry to be the Heir and the one petrifying everyone. However, Harry, Ron and Hermione believe Draco Malfoy is the Heir. They brew a batch of Polyjuice Potion in an unused girls' bathroom haunted by a ghost named Moaning Myrtle. This will allow Harry and Ron to transform into Slytherins Crabbe and Goyle, slip into the Slytherin common room, and hear what Draco himself has to say about the situation. They find out that Draco is not the Heir, but that it was last open fifty years ago and a student was attacked by the creature and died.

Tom Riddle transports Harry back in time fifty years, where he witnesses a confrontation between Tom and Hagrid. Hagrid is seen protecting a creature that Tom accuses of being the one that killed the student.

Hermione is found petrified with a mirror in her hand. Harry and Ron use the Invisibility Cloak to sneak off and visit Hagrid. There they witness the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge telling Dumbledore that Hagrid must be sent to Azkaban, the wizard prison. Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, arrives, and announces Dumbledore's suspension as headmaster of Hogwarts. Hagrid's parting words lead Harry and Ron to the Forbidden Forest to meet Aragog, a giant spider. It is revealed that he is the creature Hagrid was protecting fifty year before, but he isn't the creature hidding in the chamber.

    <string name="book5Summ">Harry Potter is spending his summer with his awful aunt and uncle when he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by two dementors. Harry defends himself and his cousin by casting a Patronus Charm. Soon after, Harry is visited by a group of wizards who are all members of the Order of the Phoenix. The wizards take Harry to his godfather’s, Sirius Black’s, home in London. There he learns about the Order led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore and its quest to fight Lord Voldemort and his followers. The Order is a secret organization that does not comply with the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry is being led by Cornelius Fudge and is not willing to believe the Dark Lord has returned.
	Because Harry used magic to defend himself from the dementors, he is summoned by the Ministry for a disciplinary hearing. Although underaged wizards are not permitted to use magic outside of school, Harry is not punished and free to return to Hogwarts thanks to the help of Dumbledore.
	Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is reunited with his best friends Ron and Hermione. Once there, he learns that Dolores Umbridge, an evil and corrupt member of the Ministry, is to be the new Defense against the Dark Arts professor. It is clear the Ministry is now becoming more involved at Hogwarts. The Daily Prophet, a wizard newspaper, keeps printing lies about Harry Potter and accusing Harry of faking Voldemort’s return. This causes tension between Harry and his fellow classmates.
	Umbridge refuses to teach students how to defend themselves, claiming children have no reason to learn to fight. Cornelius Fudge grants Umbridge more power and she can now insect and evaluate the other professors at Hogwarts. Knowing the situation is becoming dire, Harry, Ron, and Hermione create Dumbledore’s Army where other students can join and learn to defend themselves from dark magic.
	Harry has been having dreams/visions of walking through the Department of Mysteries inside the Ministry of Magic. In his visions, he walks into a room filled with glass orbs. Harry wakes before finding out the meaning of his dream. One night, however, Harry has a vision where he takes on the body of a snake and attacks Ron’s father. Harry informs Dumbledore and the Order rescues Mr. Weasley. To protect Harry from Voldemort and these visions, Dumbledore requires Harry to taking Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.
	Dumbledore’s Army, meanwhile, is making great improvements as the student grow stronger. They are caught when Umbridge forces one of the members to confess. Professor Dumbledore takes full responsibility and must resign as headmaster. Umbridge takes his position as headmaster of Hogwarts.
	Harry has another vision where this time, it is Sirius Black that is being held captive and tortured. Hermione is concerned Voldemort may be trying to lure Harry, but Harry is too worried about Sirius to heed her warning. Harry sneaks into Umbridge’s office and uses her fireplace to transport to Sirius’ home. Once there, the house elf tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry. Harry returns to Hogwarts to find that his friends are being held by Umbridge in her office.
	Harry and Hermione lie to Umbridge, saying they were hiding a weapon in the Forbidden Forest for Dumbledore. They lead her out into the forest where they are met by a group of Centaurs who carry Umbridge away. With no time to spare, Harry and his friends race to the Ministry to try to save Sirius Black. However, after searching the Ministry for him, Harry realizes Hermione was right and it was all a trap. While searching, Harry finds a glass orb with his and Voldemort’s name on it. He grabs it and is then surrounded by Death Eaters, demanding the prophecy.
	Harry and his friends use the skills they learned from Dumbledore’s Army to fight the Death Eaters. Eventually, members of the Order arrive to help them. While fighting, Harry accidentally drops the orb and it shatters. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s estranged cousin, kills Sirius and Harry is devastated to have lost what little family he had left.
	Dumbledore appears and fights off the rest of the Death Eaters. Bellatrix and Voldemort escape as Fudge arrives. Harry is sent back to school where Dumbledore explains the orb was a prophecy containing power Voldemort knows nothing about: Love. The prophecy goes on to explain the Harry with either destroy Voldemort or be killed by him. Dumbledore also explains why Harry must always spend his summers with the Durselys. Harry’s mother blessed Harry with her love when she died trying to protect him. This blessing can only be sealed by blood. Harry’s Aunt Petunia seals this bond by taking Harry into her home. With this knowledge, Harry returns home to his aunt’s and uncle’s for one more summer.

It becomes apparent that Draco is using the Room of Requirement which transforms itself to meet the needs of whoever is using it. The room does not appear on the map which is why Harry has difficulty finding him. Harry cannot enter the room until he figures out what Draco is using it for.
	Dumbledore takes Harry to retrieve Merope’s locket, the locket that belonged to Voldemort’s mother. By destroying the horcrux, Voldemort will be one step closer to mortality.

He tries to stall Draco, telling the young wizard he is not a killer and that the Order of the Phoenix could protect him and his mother. Draco begins to lower his wand and Snape quickly enters. Snape raises his wand and kills Dumbledore. When killed, Dumbledore’s spell on Harry is broken and he races after Snape to try to avenge Dumbledore. Snape escapes with the other Death Eaters and the entire school is devastated. Harry inspects the locket retrieved earlier and realizes it is not a Horcrux. Inside, there is a note from “R. A. B.”.

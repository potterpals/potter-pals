    <string name="book5Summ">Harry Potter is spending his summer with his awful aunt and uncle when he and his cousin Dudley are attacked by two dementors. Harry defends himself and his cousin by casting a Patronus Charm. Soon after, Harry is visited by a group of wizards who are all members of the Order of the Phoenix. The wizards take Harry to his godfather’s, Sirius Black’s, home in London. There he learns about the Order led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore and its quest to fight Lord Voldemort and his followers. The Order is a secret organization that does not comply with the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry is being led by Cornelius Fudge and is not willing to believe the Dark Lord has returned.
	Because Harry used magic to defend himself from the dementors, he is summoned by the Ministry for a disciplinary hearing. Although underaged wizards are not permitted to use magic outside of school, Harry is not punished and free to return to Hogwarts thanks to the help of Dumbledore.
	Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and is reunited with his best friends Ron and Hermione. Once there, he learns that Dolores Umbridge, an evil and corrupt member of the Ministry, is to be the new Defense against the Dark Arts professor. It is clear the Ministry is now becoming more involved at Hogwarts. The Daily Prophet, a wizard newspaper, keeps printing lies about Harry Potter and accusing Harry of faking Voldemort’s return. This causes tension between Harry and his fellow classmates.
	Umbridge refuses to teach students how to defend themselves, claiming children have no reason to learn to fight. Cornelius Fudge grants Umbridge more power and she can now insect and evaluate the other professors at Hogwarts. Knowing the situation is becoming dire, Harry, Ron, and Hermione create Dumbledore’s Army where other students can join and learn to defend themselves from dark magic.
	Harry has been having dreams/visions of walking through the Department of Mysteries inside the Ministry of Magic. In his visions, he walks into a room filled with glass orbs. Harry wakes before finding out the meaning of his dream. One night, however, Harry has a vision where he takes on the body of a snake and attacks Ron’s father. Harry informs Dumbledore and the Order rescues Mr. Weasley. To protect Harry from Voldemort and these visions, Dumbledore requires Harry to taking Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.
	Dumbledore’s Army, meanwhile, is making great improvements as the student grow stronger. They are caught when Umbridge forces one of the members to confess. Professor Dumbledore takes full responsibility and must resign as headmaster. Umbridge takes his position as headmaster of Hogwarts.
	Harry has another vision where this time, it is Sirius Black that is being held captive and tortured. Hermione is concerned Voldemort may be trying to lure Harry, but Harry is too worried about Sirius to heed her warning. Harry sneaks into Umbridge’s office and uses her fireplace to transport to Sirius’ home. Once there, the house elf tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry. Harry returns to Hogwarts to find that his friends are being held by Umbridge in her office.
	Harry and Hermione lie to Umbridge, saying they were hiding a weapon in the Forbidden Forest for Dumbledore. They lead her out into the forest where they are met by a group of Centaurs who carry Umbridge away. With no time to spare, Harry and his friends race to the Ministry to try to save Sirius Black. However, after searching the Ministry for him, Harry realizes Hermione was right and it was all a trap. While searching, Harry finds a glass orb with his and Voldemort’s name on it. He grabs it and is then surrounded by Death Eaters, demanding the prophecy.
	Harry and his friends use the skills they learned from Dumbledore’s Army to fight the Death Eaters. Eventually, members of the Order arrive to help them. While fighting, Harry accidently drops the orb and it shatters. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius’s estranged cousin, kills Sirius and Harry is devastated to have lost what little family he had left.
	Dumbledore appears and fights off the rest of the Death Eaters. Bellatrix and Voldemort escape as Fudge arrives. Harry is sent back to school where Dumbledore explains the orb was a prophecy containing power Voldemort knows nothing about: Love. The prophecy goes on to explain the Harry with either destroy Voldemort or be killed by him. Dumbledore also explains why Harry must always spend his summers with the Durselys. Harry’s mother blessed Harry with her love when she died trying to protect him. This blessing can only be sealed by blood. Harry’s Aunt Petunia seals this bond by taking Harry into her home. With this knowledge, Harry returns home to his aunt’s and uncle’s for one more summer.

    <string name="book6Summ">The world is in complete disarray as Harry Potter enters his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Voldemort and his followers are growing more powerful and wreaking havoc on both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. The prime minister of the Muggle world meets with the past and current Ministers of Magic. It reveals that all is not well, there is a war at hand and even Hogwarts is no longer safe.
	Severus Snape, a professor at Hogwarts, is thought to be an enemy of Voldemort and a supporter of the Order of the Phoenix. However, he meets with Narcissa Malfoy, Draco Malfoy’s mother and wife of a well-known Death Eater. Snape makes an unbreakable vow to Narcissa and promises to keep Draco safe.
	Meanwhile, Harry Potter had been spending his summer with the Durselys. Dumbledore arrives to collect Harry. The two wizards go to recruit Horace Slughorn and convince him to return to teaching at Hogwarts. Slughorn is star-struck by Harry and reluctantly agrees, claiming he had been hiding from Voldemort’s army. Dumbledore then takes Harry to the Weasleys where he is reunited with his friends Ron and Hermione.
	Harry and the Weasleys are shopping for school supplies when Harry spots Draco Malfoy acting suspicious. Harry follows Draco to Borgin and Burkes, where Draco is aggressively demanding Borgin fix a mysterious object. Harry now believes Draco has become a Death Eater and is working for Voldemort.
	Harry finally returns to Hogwarts for his sixth year. Dumbledore announces that Professor Snape will now be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. This year, Harry is taking a Potions class taught by Professor Slughorn. He receives a very used Potions textbook ad inside it says the book is property of the “Half-Blood Prince”. The book is filled with notes and amendments from the previous owner, allowing Harry to do exceptionally well in the class.
	Dumbledore and Harry meet on a regular basis to use Dumbledore’s pensieve to observe the memories of people who had direct contact with Voldemort. Dumbledore hopes that learning about Voldemort’s past will prepare Harry for when he and the Dark Lord meet face to face. Harry learned about Voldemort’s family and how Voldemort was left at an orphanage to grow up to be a generally unpleasant boy. Most importantly, Harry learns about how Voldemort ripped his soul into seven Horcruxes. Two of the Horcruxes, Voldemort’s grandfather’s ring and Tom Riddle’s diary, have already been destroyed. This leaves five known horcruxes: something that reside within Voldemort, a snake, Voldemort’s mother’s locket, and two hidden objects.
	Meanwhile, Ron begins dating Lavender Brown which causes Hermione to become jealous and create tension within the friend group. Harry begins to develop feeling for Ron’s sister Ginny. Ron and Lavender eventually break up, making Hermione very happy. Harry divides his attention between his responsibilities between being Quidditch captain and following Draco. He tries to track Draco using the Marauder’s Map, but many times cannot find him. It becomes apparent that Draco is using the Room of Requirement which transforms itself to meet the needs of whoever is using it. The room does not appear on the map which is why Harry has difficulty finding him. Harry cannot enter the room until he figures out what Draco is using it for.
	Dumbledore takes Harry to retrieve Merope’s locket, the locket that belonged to Voldemort’s mother. By destroying the horcrux, Voldemort will be one step closer to mortality. Harry and Dumbledore push through a series of traps and challenges and eventually come across a basin. The locket is hidden beneath a poisonous potion. Harry fights off a swarm of Inferi, dead bodies reanimated by Dark Magic, while Dumbledore drinks the potion. The two wizards obtain the locket and return to Hogwarts; Dumbledore is very weak. When they return, Voldemort’s mark is floating above the school.
	Harry and Dumbledore race to the tower beneath the Dark Mark. Once there, Dumbledore freezes Harry using magic and hides him beneath his cloak of invisibility. Draco rushes into the room and threatens to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore is weak and his wand is out of reach. He tries to stall Draco, telling the young wizard he is not a killer and that the Order of the Phoenix could protect him and his mother. Draco begins to lower his wand and Snape quickly enters. Snape raises his wand and kills Dumbledore. When killed, Dumbledore’s spell on Harry is broken and he races after Snape to try to avenge Dumbledore. Snape escapes with the other Death Eaters and the entire school is devastated. Harry inspects the locket retrieved earlier and realizes it is not a Horcrux. Inside, there is a note from “R. A. B.”. Harry decides to not return to Hogwarts next year and will instead find and destroy Horcruxes and ultimately kill Voldemort. Ron and Hermione will join him.
